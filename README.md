# NBA Regular Season EDA (2012-2016)
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on NBA player statistics obtained from a dataset on kaggle that contains data scraped from the official NBA website. It uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to extract insights, analyze performance trends, and visualize scoring efficiency, team dynamics, and player contributions. The goal is to derive meaningful insights, visualize trends as I delve into data analytics. 

**Calculated custom performance metrics like**
- PPG (Points Per Game)
- FPG (Field Goal Attempts Per Game)
- Efficiency Score
- SE (Scoring Efficiency)

**Answered key analytical questions such as**
- Who are the most efficient high scorers?
- Which teams rely the most on a single player?
- Which players had the highest overall efficiency?
- Is there a correlation between scoring and assists?
- Which teams are most efficient in scoring on average?

**Used charts and graphs to visually support findings and some visualizations such as**
- The spread of players across the various teams
- The distribution of PPG of various players
- The increase in PPG as FGA increases and the exceptions

**Technologies Used**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
